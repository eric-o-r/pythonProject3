This is my attempt at propellant tank sizing code for my MAE 478 Class
Current configuration uses Hydrazine and LoX as my teams propellants.
A factor of safety of 1.25 is applied for the structural sizing.

All equations used come from "Modern Engineering for Design of Liquid_Propellant Rocket Engines"
